# Individual datasets
- [**UseGeo - UAV-based multi-sensor dataset for geospatial research**](https://github.com/3DOM-FBK/usegeo)
   - a large-scale real-world set of data suitable for multiple tasks, such as monocular depth estimation, multi-view 3D reconstruction (MVS), etc.
- **LiSurveying: A high-resolution TLS-LiDAR benchmark**
   - The first large-scale hybrid (point-wise and 3D bounding box) TLS-LiDAR dataset for LS.
   - LiSurveying provides 360 degrees of sensor coverage in multiple locations of the scene, where multiple scans are integrated to obtain a massive point-cloud representation.
   - LiSurveying provides rich data for research on object classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection for complex outdoor scenes.
- [**An open-source photogrammetry workflow for reconstructing 3D models**](https://osf.io/b39yx/)
-  KITTI
   - a pioneer multimodal dataset that includes point-clouds from a LiDAR sensor as well as front-facing stereo images and GPS/IMU data. This dataset with 8 classes is useful for AV applications using MLS point-clouds and front-facing stereo images. This dataset contains about 15k point-cloud frames with 200k 3D bounding boxes on 22 different scenes.
